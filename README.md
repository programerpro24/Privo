# Privo - Real-Time Chat & Meeting Platform
Privo is a full-stack real-time communication platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and WebSockets (Socket.io).

This application allows users to securely authenticate, then create or join "rooms" where they can send real-time messages and conduct virtual meetings.

# Features
# Secure Authentication: 
Users can safely sign-up and log in with hashed passwords, implemented using Bcrypt.

# Real-Time Chat: 
Instant, bidirectional messaging powered by Socket.io.

# Meeting Rooms: 
Users can create or join dynamic rooms for private, group-based conversations.

# RESTful Backend: 
A robust backend built on REST principles using Express.js and Mongoose to manage users and rooms.
